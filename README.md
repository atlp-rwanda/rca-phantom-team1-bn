# Vision
Make daily Kigali Commute easy and convenient for the thousands of people who use public transport to move to and from different areas of Kigali.

# What we’re trying to do
Currently in Rwanda, specifically in Kigali, commuters spend on average 45 minutes at the bus stations or in queues waiting for buses to come, and this number normally goes high in peak hours (7:00 - 8:00, 18:00 - 20:00).

Commuters would love a solution to address this problem; they would like to have a way to check the location of buses on their respective routes and plan accordingly so they don’t have to wait for them.

This is the problem Phantom is here to solve: Create an application that allows simulating bus movements and enabling passengers to track their locations & movements.
